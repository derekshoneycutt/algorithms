# Algorithms Grab-bag

This is just a fun little project for myself to write a bunch of algorithms and data
structures in a bunch of different languages. Why not?


The languages that I am interested in are ones that are not too amazingly difficult
to setup to build and run a single file at a time. Sometimes that is a little bit
more convoluted than other times, but I am not interested in creating whole projects.
Each file is rather to be its own standalone and follow common patterns.

## Languages

I explore many different languages. This is a rough list that may more may not be entirely up to date ever.

### Assembly
