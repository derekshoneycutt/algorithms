Given 2 +int m, n, find greatest common divisor;
    largest +int evenly divide both m, n.

1. [Remainder m/n.] Divide m by n; let m be remainder.

2. [Is it zero?] If m = 0, return n.

3. [Remainder n/m.] Divide n by m; let n be remainder.

3. [Reduce.] If n = 0, return m; otherwise goto 1.



NOTE: This was taken as an exercise from Knuth's The Art of Computer Programming.
It's mostly superfluous in modern langauges, though it does prove an interesting
point in the assembly languages. We'll go ahead with it as an exercise throughout
nonetheless.
